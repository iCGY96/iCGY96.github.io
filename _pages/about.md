I received my Ph.D. degree at [National Engineering Research Center of Visual Technology](http://idm.pku.edu.cn/), [School of Computer Science](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn), supervisedÂ byÂ Prof.[YonghongÂ Tian](https://www.pkuml.org/). I received my Bachelor degree in Computer Science from Wuhan University in 2018.

My current research strives to learn efficient and robust AI models with prior knowledge, and reasoning and decision-making in the open world.
